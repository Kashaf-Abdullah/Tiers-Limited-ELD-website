            Understanding Electronic Logging Devices (ELDs)
          </h4>
          <p className="text">
            ELDs have revolutionized the way trucking companies manage their
            fleets. By replacing traditional paper logs with electronic systems,
            ELDs offer real-time tracking of driversâ€™ hours of service (HOS),
            ensuring compliance with DOT regulations. Beyond regulatory
            compliance, ELDs enhance efficiency by optimizing route planning,
            monitoring vehicle performance, and facilitating seamless
            communication between drivers and dispatchers.
